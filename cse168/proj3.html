					<h5>Indirect Path Tracer, Assignment 3:</h5>
					<hr>
					<div class="content">
						<p>This project is based off of the previous Ray Tracing, Assignment 1 project and Direct Lighting, Assignment 2 project. Just as in Assignment 1 and 2, the codebase was written in C++ with no external graphics libraries (e.g. Optix, OpenGL). All of the library functionality for vectors, matricies, and their corresponding mathematical operations were implemented by me.</p>

						<p>The goal of this assignment was to implement a path tracer that captures multiple bounces of light rays off objects in the scene. In comparison to only direct lighting, this greatly improves the realism of the rendered image and enables many lighting effects such as color bleeding, causics, and near-mirror reflections. The path tracer was implemented using Monte Carlo sampling of the hemisphere around the surface of the intersected rays's object for each ray bounce. In order to reduce noise, next event estimation was implemented. In order to allow for an infinite number of ray bounces, Russian roulette was implemented</p>

						<p>I found this assignment to be difficult, yet rewarding. This is the most code I have built from the ground up in any of my courses so far. Seeing all of the different functionalities from each of the previous assignments come together (raytracing with optimization, direct lighting, and now indirect lighting), to now have very realistic image generating is very exciting to see.</p>
